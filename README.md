# WindowsAudio
Small program that toggles the mute status of the default capture device. Plays two different windows sounds when muting/unmuting,

Made it because my microphone didn't have a hardware button and I wanted to be able to mute on the go. I also wanted to experiment with programming Windows stuff.
A macro on my keyboard runs the program and it serves my needs.

If anyone wants to make a pull request so that it doesn't minimize fullscreen apps when it runs, please do. I run everything "Windowed Borderless" so it is not too annoying to me, but still.
